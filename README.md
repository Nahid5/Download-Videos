Made using python3  

**You need the user_agents.txt file**

To use:
```
python3 downloadVideos.py [http://example.com]
```
or
```
pyhton3 downloadVideos.py [file_with_links]

If you are going to input a file with all of the links, make sure that the links
are all in different lines.  So the file should look this:
```
[address1]
[address2]
[address3]
[address4]
